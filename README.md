There are 3 pins on softpot. Pin 1 which is the one with the arrow refers to ground, pin 2 refers to sensor and pin 3 refers to power. Pin 1 was connected to the ground GND on adruino, pin 2 is connected to ADC, and pin 3 is connected to 3.3v.

Below is the pictures after the connections has been made:
