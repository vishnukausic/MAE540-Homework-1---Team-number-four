Testing of Softpot Membrane Potentiometer

## AIM
The aim of the experiment is to explain the application of Softpot Membrane Potentiometer and to provide necessary information for setting up the sensor.

## APPLICATION
A basic potentiometer converts mechanical displacement into electrical energy, and has applications which is suitable for injection molding machines, woodworking machinery, printing, spraying, machine tools, robotics, Dimming of lights, regulating fan speed, engineering, computer-controlled monitoring of sports equipment etc. The main disadvantage of the normal potentiometer is the big size and cost. The potentiometer used here is the **Softpot Membrane potentiometer**. The figure below shows diagram of a Softpot Membrane potentiometer.

Combining the applications of a potentiometer and the advantages like small size, less cost will make the sensor suitable for medical applications where normal sensors will malfunction due to the harsh conditions like radiation.

## Introduction to the SoftPot Membrane Potentiometer

1. The SoftPot membrane potentiometer acts as an infinitely variable analog voltage divider. 
2. SoftPot Membrane Potentiometer is a very thin variable potentiometer.
3. We can vary the resistance linearly from 10 ohms to 10,000 ohms by pressing down on the various parts of the strip, allowing the user accurately calculate the relative position on the strip.
4. It consists of three layers: **Top layer with silver shunt, Space layer and Bottom layer with conductive carbon**.
5. Top layer closes the bottom layer when actuated, thus producing a reading. 
6. It be used as an accurate positional indicator for CNC head positioning, variable user input, straight user input and many other applications.

### Features of SoftPot

1. Lower cost than Mechanical Potentiometers
2. Sealed for harsh environments
3. Polyester substrate
4. Low set-up costs with versatility of custom design. 
5. Small [form factor][1].
6. We can combine multiple SoftPot on the same control panel.

### Specifications of SoftPot

1. Mounting Type : Custom
2. Operating Temperature Range : -40°C to 50°C
3. Resistance tolerance: ± 20%
4. Resistance (ohms) : 10K
