Testing of Softpot Membrane Potentiometer
## Introduction

1. The SoftPot membrane potentiometer acts as an infinitely variable analog voltage divider. 
2. SoftPot Membrane Potentiometer is a very thin variable potentiometer.
3. We can vary the resistance linearly from 10 ohms to 10,000 ohms by pressing down on the various of the strip, allowing the user accurately calculate the relative position on the strip.
4. It consists of three layers: **Top layer with silver shunt, Space layer and Bottom layer with conductive carbon**.
5. Top layer closes the bottom layer when actuated, thus producing a reading.

### Features of SoftPot

1. Lower cost than Mechanical Potentiometers
2. Sealed for harsh environments
3. Low set-up costs with versatility of custom design. 
4. Small form factor.
5. We can combine multiple SoftPot on the same control panel.
