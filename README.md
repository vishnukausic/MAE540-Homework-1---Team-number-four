Testing of Softpot Membrane Potentiometer
--
## AIM
The aim of the experiment is to explain the application of Softpot Membrane Potentiometer and to provide necesary information for setting up the sensor.

## APPLICATION
A basic potentiometer converts mechanical displacement into electrical energy, and has applications which is suitable for injection molding machines, woodworking machinery, printing, spraying, machine tools, robotics,Dimming of lights, regulating fan speed, engineering, computer-controlled monitoring of sports equipment etc. The main disadvantage of the normal potentiometer is the big size. The potentiometer used here is the **Softpot Membrane potentiometer**.
